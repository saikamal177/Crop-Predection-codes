# Crop-Predection-codes
Agriculture being a soil-based industry, an increase in yield can only be attained by ensuring that the soil provides a balanced and an adequate supply of nutrients. 

Soil testing is pivotal in understanding the deficiencies in soil and avoiding nutrient imbalance.

Using Machine learning techniques, from the soil analysis data set, we will predict the suitable crop for the farmers.

This helps farmers to sow the suitable seeds that will give a better yield eventually Which leads to better profit 

The Aim of the project is to analyse the soil properties and predict the suitable crop that eventually gives a good yield and profit to the farmers using Machine learning techniques
